        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Completion of this workflow will result in a published dataset with a single resource</li>
          <li>The same workflow pages will be used for adding a new dataset and editing an existing one</li>
          <li>When a dataset author opts to 'Save and exit' before publishing a dataset ... 
            <ul>
              <li>they land on their profile page with the dataset they were working on listed as a 'Draft'</li>
              <li>when they are ready to return to editing a 'Draft' dataset, they select it from the list in their 'Profile' and should land on the first workflow page containing incomplete data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Authors can navigate freely between completed workflow pages in a draft dataset</li>
          <li>When editing (as opposed to creating) a dataset, the check marks that indicate progress in the navigation bar return to being numbers</li>
          <li>When creating a dataset, an activity stream event should be logged upon dataset publication</li>
          <li>When editing a dataset, an activity stream event should be logged for any and all field updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do we want a 'Cancel' or 'Delete Draft' button to bail out of a partially created dataset?</li>
          <li>How do we handle a dataset author leaving a partially filled in workflow page without clicking 'Save' or 'Next'? Warning dialog? Allow and do nothing (discarding partial data)?</li>
          <li>What happens when a resource file/link is updated? Are relevant date fields updated automatically? Is there any trigger to prompt author to review data dictionary, etc if data fields have been updated?</li>
          <li>What happens on the data dictionary page when the resource is not a tabular file type?</li>
          <li>Does Next/Publish button become 'Update' when editing an existing dataset, or do you still have to 'Next' through the pages?</li>
          <li>How does Datapusher fit in? Is a push triggered on completion of step 1? At what point are Datapusher errors handled?</li>
          <li>Responsive version? Vertical expansion-tab interface with nav bar rotated 90 degrees should work ... </li>
          <li>Visibility: Public/Private field missing from wireframes?
